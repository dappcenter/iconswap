## Introduction

ICONSwap is a fully **open source**, **free** (excluding ICON transaction fees) service that allows any ICONist to **trade safely** any of their IRC2 tokens against any amount of ICX or IRC2 tokens.

For doing so, this service implements a simple **[Atomic swap](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Atomic_swap)** algorithm on ICON.

It is an alternative to the [Over-The-Counter](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc.asp) (OTC) trading method taking place on few unlisted tokens on ICON. This method is insecure as the trade isn't atomic.

Please note that **ICONSwap is not a marketplace** : there is no book order, no automatic orders filling ; the ICONists need to find someone else interested in trading its tokens with in other channels.

Alternatively, ICONSwap may be used by other SCORE developers willing to implement an atomic swap in their contract : the ICONSwap SCORE contract may be called from another SCORE.
