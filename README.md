## Introduction

ICONSwap is a fully **open source**, **free** service that allows any ICONist to **safely trade** with anyone IRC2 tokens against any other.

It is an alternative solution to the [Over-The-Counter](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc.asp) (OTC) trading method taking place on few unlisted tokens on ICON.

Alternatively, ICONSwap may be used by other SCORE developers willing to implement a token swap in their contract : the ICONSwap SCORE contract may be called from another SCORE.
